            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              The Eco Guardian app has been active since September 2016. 
              Over the past several years, users have utilized Eco Guardian to submit over 75 thousand reports (as of Dec 2022) related to pollution odors. 
              These data offer multiple accounts of the human impacts of air pollution and provide insights into the air quality landscape of our region. 
              Collectively, the community has engaged in documenting conditions of the air and has made connections between air quality and our health. 
              To highlight patterns and insights in the thousands of Eco Guardian reports, this page outlines data analyses curated by Dr. Yen-Chia Hsu from the CREATE Lab. 
              These assessments are based on Eco Guardian data from 2017 through 2022. 
              In the sections below, we examine these data from several different aspects in order to understand:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Levels and types of report submissions and public engagement</li>
              <li>How reports are distributed over time and across neighborhoods</li>
              <li>Patterns in the content of reports</li>
              <li>Links between smell reports and pollutants in the air</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              The number of reports submitted through the Eco Guardian app had steadily increased from 2017 to 2020 (see <a href="#table1">Table 1</a>). 
              However, there has been a downward trend in app use in the past few years (see <a href="#table2">Table 2</a>).
              Many users who used Eco Guardian were actively engaged, with 25% to 50% of users submitting more than one report in a given week and/or month. 
              When looking at the region, we saw greater engagement with the app across local areas over the years. 
              Local air quality at a given time appeared to affect the level of engagement with Eco Guardian, with more users interacting with the app during poor air quality conditions. 
              The Eco Guardian map, which visualizes smell reports across our region as well as local air quality data, was another significant aspect of engagement, with over 80% of app users interacting with the map.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              When looking at overall submissions, most pollution odor reports (over 70% each year) were rated 3 or higher, on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being just fine, and 5 being as bad as it gets). 
              Reports were primarily submitted during morning hours (especially between 7 and 10am), and were less frequent at nighttime. 
              Most user comments described industrial pollution odors and symptoms related to air pollution exposure. 
              Odor descriptions and symptoms were frequently linked to hydrogen sulfide, which has a "rotten egg" smell and is known to cause symptoms of headaches, dizziness, eye irritation, sore throat, cough, nausea, and shortness of breath 
              (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.pa.32.040192.000545" target="_blank">Reiffenstein et al., 1992</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1091581810384882" target="_blank">Guidotti, 2010</a>). 
              These narratives align with our finding that hydrogen sulfide is a significant driver of smell reports.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              Using Eco Guardian reports and air quality data from local monitoring stations, we developed a statistical model to predict upcoming smell events and send push notifications to inform communities. 
              Our analysis indicated that odor pollution events in the region are related to the joint effect of wind directions and hydrogen sulfide readings. 
              This research shows that engaging residents in documenting their experiences with pollution odors can help identify local air pollution patterns. 
              The dataset and code utilized in this analysis are <a href="https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_REPO" target="_blank">publicly available on GitHub</a>.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              To understand user engagement over time, we aggregated the number of reports and unique users by month and also assessed the distribution of report ratings by year. 
              In general, user engagement based on the number of reports submitted was higher in 2020 than any calendar year. 
              Each time a user submits a report, it is aggregated by the total number of submitted reports in a year.
              Most users submitted up to about 100 reports a year, while a small number reported pollution odors more frequently, with some submitting over 200 reports in 2019 and 2022.

              For a breakdown of user engagement by year, please see Figure 3. 
              The analysis shows a clear decline in user engagement from 2020 onwards, as indicated by the reduction in the number of active users who consistently submitted reports throughout the year. 
              This pattern may be attributed to various factors, including changes in air quality or user behavior.
            </p>
            <h2>Patterns in Report Content</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              When analyzing the content of reports, we found that over 70% of the reports described odors rated 3 or higher on the 5-point scale. 
              Reports were most frequently submitted between 7 and 10 am, with fewer reports being submitted at night. 
              User comments often referenced industrial pollution odors and symptoms consistent with air pollution exposure. 
              Notably, hydrogen sulfide was frequently mentioned in user descriptions and was identified as a key contributor to smell reports.
            </p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
              The data presented in Figure 4 indicates that most user comments related to hydrogen sulfide exposure, with reported symptoms aligning with known effects of this pollutant. 
              The figure also shows that reports were more frequent during industrial activities and in areas with known pollution sources.
            </p>
            <h2>Link Between Reports and Air Quality</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              To understand the relationship between smell reports and air quality, we analyzed data from local air monitoring stations alongside Eco Guardian reports. 
              Our analysis revealed that higher levels of hydrogen sulfide were associated with increased reports of pollution odors. 
              This correlation was further validated by the statistical model used to predict smell events based on wind direction and hydrogen sulfide readings.
            </p>
            <div id="figure5" style="text-align: center; color: dimgray"><i><b>Figure 5: Correlation Between Hydrogen Sulfide Levels and Smell Reports</b></i></div>
            <img src="img/figure5.png" alt="Figure 5: Correlation Between Hydrogen Sulfide Levels and Smell Reports">
            <p class="text">
              The analysis in Figure 5 demonstrates a significant correlation between hydrogen sulfide levels and the frequency of smell reports. 
              This finding supports the effectiveness of using Eco Guardian data to identify and address local air pollution issues.
